\usage{
run_spline_model_cv(
  idps,
  trait,
  age,
  conf,
  conf_names,
  trait_id,
  remove_age,
  model_age
)
}
\arguments{
\item{idps}{A matrix or data frame of input features (IDPs).}

\item{trait}{A vector of the trait to predict.}

\item{age}{A vector of subject ages.}

\item{conf}{A data frame of additional confounding variables.}

\item{conf_names}{A character vector of confound variable names.}

\item{trait_id}{An integer representing the trait ID.}

\item{remove_age}{A boolean indicating whether to remove the age variable from the model.}

\item{model_age}{A boolean indicating whether to include age as a linear feature in the model.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item spline_yhat: Predicted trait values for the test data.
\item corr_train: Correlations for the training folds.
\item corr_test: Correlations for the test folds.
\item models: List of fitted models for each fold.
}
}
\description{
Fits a spline model using 10-fold cross-validation and calculates correlations for both training and test sets.

result <- run_spline_model_cv(idps, trait, age, conf, conf_names, trait_id, TRUE, TRUE)
